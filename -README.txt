The files with _DOC name endings are the most recent version of the MDOS
utility library calls by Paul Charlton that I have been able to get.  They
are included on this disk for user convenience in using MDOS calls from
Forth.  The files 4THSRC and FORTHDOCS1 and FORTHDOCS2 are Copyright 1989
Mike McCann and licensed to those who have paid $15 for the code.
